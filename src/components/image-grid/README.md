# Image Grid

- Images within the `image-grid__image` element will be inline `img` elements and are sized using the css `ojbect-fit` property (a polyfill is included for older browsers)
- Contains room for 3 images and an optional caption
- There is a companion component associated called `image-grid-with-text` which outputs the image grid with room for a headline, text, and button - this should typically be used for output globally
