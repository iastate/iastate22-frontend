# Callout With Image

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/callout-with-image/callout-with-image";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--callout-with-image">`.
